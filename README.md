# LLM--NLP-task-with-transformers
This project is a comprehensive exploration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and their practical applications, developed as part of an LLM (Large Language Model) course. The project covers a variety of use cases to showcase the versatility and power of modern NLP methods:

1.	Sentence Classification: Assigning categories to entire sentences based on their content.
2.	Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying each word in a sentence into predefined entities such as names, locations, or organizations.
3.	Question Answering: Extracting precise answers to questions given a specific context or passage.
4.	Text Summarization: Condensing long passages into concise summaries while preserving the main ideas.
5.	Fill-in-the-Blank Tasks: Predicting missing words or phrases in incomplete sentences.
6.	Language Translation: Converting text from one language to another while maintaining meaning and fluency.
The project utilizes state-of-the-art tools and libraries, such as Hugging Face Transformers and pre-trained LLMs, to deliver robust and scalable solutions for each use case. This hands-on experience demonstrates the real-world applications of NLP in various domains, such as customer support, content generation, and multilingual communication.
